# Exploring_the_Weather_in_Athens_Visualizations

In this assignment I explore the weather in Athens over a period of more than 50 years.
I created these 4 visualizations in order to gain insights about the climate change-the temperature, the rainy days through each year and about the 'extreme events':
1) Deviation of Summer Temperatures
2) Evolution of Daily Temperatures
3) Extreme Temperature Events
4) Precipitation
